# NAMMA_YATRI_Trips_Dashboard

In this project, I have tried to replicate the Namma Yatri dashboard within the dynamic environment of Power BI. Using dummy information that faithfully replicates real-world data, I have meticulously recreated the Namma Yatri Dashboard on this platform, allowing us to visualize and interact with trips data in an intuitive and insightful manner.

Beyond the dashboard replication, we have delved deeper into the data through exploratory data analysis (EDA). With the help of SQL queries, we have unraveled hidden patterns, uncovered valuable insights, and answered crucial questions about the transportation system.
